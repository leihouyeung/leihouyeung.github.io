I am currently a computer science Ph.D. student at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Xin Gao](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/xin-gao). 

I am broadly interested in developing computational algorithms and models (especially machine learning methods) to address biological and healthcare problems. My recent research focuses on medical image analysis, single-cell genomics and spatial transcriptomic.

Address: 4216-WS22, Level 4, Building 3, KAUST, Thuwal, KSA
